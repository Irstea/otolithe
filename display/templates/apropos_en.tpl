Otolith is an application which allows you to place points referenced XY on photos to calculate specific indicators. 
It was designed specifically to analyze specific parts of fish, such as otoliths (ear bones), but can also be used to treat scaly, or possibly also of fin rays.
<p>
<p>
The application was made from the framework Prototypephp (<a href="http://prototypephp.sourceforge.net">http://prototypephp.sourceforge.net</a>), en version 0.8.
